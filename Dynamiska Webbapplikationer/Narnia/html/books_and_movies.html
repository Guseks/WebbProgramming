              <h3>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</h3>
              <p>
                The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, completed by the end of March 1949 and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1950, 
                tells the story of four ordinary children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie, who have been evacuated to the English countryside from London in 1940 
                following the outbreak of World War II. They discover a wardrobe in Professor Digory Kirke's house that leads to the magical land of Narnia. 
                The Pevensie children help Aslan, a talking lion, save Narnia from the evil White Witch, who has reigned over the land of Narnia for a century of perpetual winter with no Christmas. 
                The children become kings and queens of this new-found land and establish the Golden Age of Narnia, leaving a legacy to be rediscovered in later books.

              <h3>Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia</h3>
              <p>
                Completed after Christmas 1949 and published on 15 October 1951, Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia tells the story of the Pevensie children's second trip to Narnia. 
                They are drawn back by the power of Susan's horn, blown by Prince Caspian to summon help in his hour of need. Narnia, as they knew it, is no more, 
                as 1,300 years have passed and their castle is in ruins, while all Narnians have retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan's magic can wake them. 
                Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle, Miraz, who has usurped the throne. The children set out once again to save Narnia.

              <h3>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</h3>
              <p>
                Written between January and February 1950 and published on 15 September 1952, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader sees Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, along with their priggish cousin, 
                Eustace Scrubb, return to Narnia. Once there, they join Caspian's voyage on the ship Dawn Treader to find the seven lords who were banished when Miraz took over the throne. 
                This perilous journey brings them face to face with many wonders and dangers as they sail toward Aslan's country at the edge of the world.

              <h3>The Silver Chair</h3>
              <p>
                Completed at the beginning of March 1951 and published 7 September 1953, The Silver Chair is the first Narnia book not involving the Pevensie children, focusing instead on Eustace. 
                Several months after The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Aslan calls Eustace back to Narnia along with his classmate Jill Pole. 
                They are given four signs to aid them in the search for Prince Caspian's son Rilian, who disappeared ten years earlier on a quest to avenge his mother's death. 
                Fifty years have passed in Narnia; Eustace is still a child, but Caspian, barely an adult in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, is now an old man. Eustace and Jill, 
                with the help of Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle, face danger and betrayal on their quest to find Rilian.

              <h3>The Horse and His Boy</h3>
              <p>
                Begun in March and completed at the end of July 1950, The Horse and His Boy was published on 6 September 1954. 
                The story takes place during the reign of the Pevensies in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. 
                A young boy named Shasta and a talking horse named Bree, both of whom are in bondage in the country of Calormen, are the protagonists. 
                By "chance", they meet and plan their return to Narnia and freedom. Along the way they meet Aravis and her talking horse Hwin who are also fleeing to Narnia.

              <h3>The Magician's Nephew</h3>
              <p>
                Completed in February 1954 and published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, the prequel The Magician's Nephew brings the reader back to the origins of Narnia where 
                we learn how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. 
                Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings made by Digory's uncle. 
                In the dying world of Charn they awaken Queen Jadis, and they witness the creation of Narnian world (where Jadis later becomes the White Witch). 
                Many long-standing questions about the world are answered as a result. The story is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. 
                He is a middle-aged professor by the time he hosts the Pevensie children in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 40 years later.

              <p>
                Completed in March 1953 and published 4 September 1956, The Last Battle chronicles the end of the world of Narnia. 
                Jill and Eustace return to save Narnia from Shift, an ape, who tricks Puzzle, a donkey, into impersonating the lion Aslan, precipitating a showdown between the Calormenes and King Tirian. 
                This leads to the end of Narnia, revealing the true Narnia to which Aslan brings them.
