              <h3>Aslan</h3>
              <p>
                Aslan, the Great Lion, is the eponymous lion of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and his role in Narnia is developed throughout the remaining books. 
                He is also the only character to appear in all seven books. Aslan is a talking lion, the King of Beasts, son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea. 
                He is a wise, compassionate, magical authority (both temporal and spiritual) who serves as mysterious and benevolent guide to the human children who visit, 
                as well as being the guardian and saviour of Narnia. C. S. Lewis described Aslan as an alternative version of Jesus as the form in which Christ might have appeared 
                in an alternative reality.

              <h3>Lucy Pevensie</h3>
              <p>
                Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, 
                Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most. In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe she initiates the story by entering Narnia through the wardrobe, 
                and (with Susan) witnesses Aslan's execution and resurrection. She is named Queen Lucy the Valiant. In Prince Caspian she is the first to see Aslan when he comes to guide them. 
                In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, it is Lucy who breaks the spell of invisibility on the Dufflepuds. As an adult in The Horse and His Boy she helps fight the Calormenes at Anvard. 
                Although a minor character in The Last Battle, much of the closing chapter is seen from her point of view.

              <h3>Edmund Pevensie</h3>
              <p>
                Edmund is the second child to enter Narnia in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, where he falls under the White Witch's spell. 
                Instantiating that book's Christian theme of betrayal, repentance, and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice, he betrays his siblings to her, 
                but quickly realizes her true nature and her evil intentions, and is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life. He is named King Edmund the Just. 
                In Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader he supports Lucy; in The Horse and His Boy he leads the Narnian delegation to Calormen and, later, 
                the Narnian army breaking the siege at Anvard.

              <h3>Susan Pevensie</h3>
              <p>
                In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe Susan accompanies Lucy to see Aslan die and rise again. She is named Queen Susan the Gentle. In Prince Caspian, however, she is the last of the four to believe and follow Lucy when the latter is called by Aslan to guide them. As an adult queen in The Horse and His Boy she is courted by Prince Rabadash of Calormen but refuses his marriage proposal, and his angry response leads the story to its climax. In The Last Battle, we are told that she has stopped believing in Narnia and remembers it only as a childhood game.

              <h3>Peter Pevensie</h3>
              <p>
                Peter is the eldest of the Pevensies. In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe he kills a Talking Wolf to save Susan, and leads the Narnian army against the White Witch. Aslan names him High King, and he is known as Peter the Magnificent. In Prince Caspian he duels the usurper King Miraz to restore Caspian's throne. In The Last Battle it is Peter whom Aslan entrusts with the duty of closing the door on Narnia for the final time.

              <h3>Eustace Scrubb</h3>
              <p>
                Eustace Clarence Scrubb is a cousin of the Pevensies, and a classmate of Jill Pole at their school Experiment House. He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve his nasty behaviour when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while. His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible he has been, and he soon becomes a better person so Aslan changes him back into a boy. In the later books, Eustace comes across as a much nicer person, although he is still rather grumpy and argumentative. Nonetheless, he becomes a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.

              <h3>Jill Pole</h3>
              <p>
                Jill Pole is not related to any of the other children who enter Narnia. She is a classmate and neighbour of Eustace Scrubb. She appears in The Silver Chair, where she is the viewpoint character for most of the action, and returns in The Last Battle. In The Silver Chair Eustace introduces her to the Narnian world, where Aslan gives her the task of memorising a series of signs that will help her and Eustace on their quest to find Caspian's lost son. In The Last Battle she and Eustace accompany King Tirian in his ill-fated defence of Narnia against the Calormenes.

              <h3>Digory Kirke</h3>
              <p>
                Digory Kirke is the character referred to in the title of The Magician's Nephew. He first appears as a minor character in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, known only as "The Professor", who hosts the Pevensie children when they are evacuated from London and defends Lucy's story of having found a country in the back of the wardrobe. In The Magician's Nephew the young Digory, thanks to his uncle's magical experimentation, inadvertently brings Jadis from her dying homeworld of Charn to the newly-created world of Narnia; to fix his mistake Aslan sends him to fetch a magical apple which will protect Narnia and heal his dying mother. He returns in The Last Battle.

              <h3>Polly Plummer</h3>
              <p>
                Polly Plummer appears in The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. She is the next-door neighbour of the young Digory Kirke. She is tricked by a wicked magician (who is Digory's uncle) into touching a magic ring which transports her to the Wood between the Worlds and leaves her there stranded. The wicked uncle persuades Digory to follow her with a second magic ring that has the power to bring her back. This sets up the pair's adventures into other worlds, and they witness the creation of Narnia as described in The Magician's Nephew.

              <h3>Prince Caspian / Caspian X</h3>
              <p>
                Prince Caspian, later to become King Caspian X of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and Emperor of The Lone Islands – also called "Caspian the Seafarer" and "Caspian the Navigator" — is the title character of the second book in the series, first introduced as the young nephew and heir of King Miraz of Narnia. Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia is set 1300 years after the rule of High King Peter and his siblings, when Old Narnians have been driven into hiding by Caspian's ancestors the Telmarines. Caspian is also a central character in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and appears briefly at the beginning and end of The Silver Chair.

              <h3>White Witch / Jadis</h3>
              <p>
                Jadis, commonly known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. She is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter. The White Witch was born in the world of Charn, before the creation of Narnia, and died in battle in Narnian year 1000.

              <p>
                Shasta, later known as Cor of Archenland, is the principal character in The Horse and His Boy. Born the eldest son and heir of King Lune of Archenland, and elder twin of Prince Corin, Cor was kidnapped as an infant and raised as a fisherman's son in the country of Calormen. Learning that he is about to be sold into slavery at the beginning of The Horse and His Boy, Shasta escapes to freedom, saves Archenland and Narnia from invasion, learns of his true identity, and is restored to his heritage. Shasta grows up to become King of Archenland, marries the Calormene Tarkheena Aravis, and fathers the next (and most famous) king of Archenland, Ram the Great.

                Aravis, daughter of Kidrash Tarkaan, is a character in The Horse and His Boy. Escaping a forced betrothal to the loathsome Ahoshta, she joins Shasta on his journey and inadvertently overhears a plot by Rabadash, crown prince of Calormen, to invade Archenland. She later marries Shasta, now known as Prince Cor, and becomes queen of Archenland at his side.

              <p>
                Bree (Breehy-hinny-brinny-hoohy-hah) is Shasta's mount and mentor in The Horse and His Boy. A Talking Horse of Narnia, he wandered into Calormen as a foal and was captured. He first appears as a Calormene nobleman's war-horse; when the nobleman buys Shasta as a slave, Bree organises and carries out their joint escape. Though friendly, he is also vain and a braggart until his encounter with Aslan late in the story.

              <h3>Mr Tumnus</h3>
              <p>
                Tumnus is a faun who is featured prominently in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and also appears in The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle. He is the first creature Lucy meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series; he invites her to his home with the intention of betraying her to Jadis, but quickly repents and befriends her. In The Horse and His Boy he devises the Narnian delegation's plan of escape from Calormen. He returns for a brief dialogue at the end of The Last Battle. Lewis said that the first Narnia story came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood. In that way, Tumnus was the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series.

              <p>
                Trumpkin the Dwarf is the narrator of several chapters of Prince Caspian; he is one of Caspian's rescuers and a leading figure in the "Old Narnian" rebellion, and accompanies the Pevensie children from the ruins of Cair Paravel to the Old Narnian camp. In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader we learn that Caspian has made him his Regent in Narnia while he is away at sea, and he appears briefly in this role (now elderly and very deaf) in The Silver Chair.

              <p>
                Reepicheep the Mouse is the leader of the Talking Mice of Narnia in Prince Caspian. Utterly fearless, infallibly courteous, obsessed with honour, he is badly wounded in the final battle but healed by Lucy and Aslan. In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader his role is greatly expanded; he becomes a visionary as well as a warrior, and ultimately his willing self-exile to Aslan's Country breaks the enchantment on the last three of the Lost Lords, thus achieving the final goal of the quest.

                Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle guides Eustace and Jill on their quest in The Silver Chair. Though always comically pessimistic, he provides the voice of reason and as such intervenes critically in the climactic enchantment scene.

                The last King of Narnia is the viewpoint character for much of The Last Battle. Having rashly killed a Calormene for mistreating a Narnian Talking Horse, he is imprisoned by the villainous ape Shift but released by Eustace and Jill. Together they fight faithfully to the last and are welcomed into Aslan's Kingdom.

            <img src = "../bilder/NarniaCastle.jpg" alt="The royal Caste in Narnia, seen from beneath the cliff"/>
            <p>
                
              Although Lewis originally conceived what would become The Chronicles of Narnia 
              in 1939 (the picture of a Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating to 1914), 
              he did not finish writing the first book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe until 1949. 
              The Magician's Nephew, the penultimate book to be published, but the last to be written, 
              was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the books in the order in which they were 
              originally published, nor were they published in their current chronological order of 
              presentation. The original illustrator, 
              Pauline Baynes, created pen and ink drawings for the Narnia books that are still used in the editions 
              published today. 
              Lewis was awarded the 1956 Carnegie Medal for The Last Battle, the final book in the saga. 
              Fellow children's author Roger Lancelyn Green first referred to the series as The Chronicles of Narnia, 
              in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed fourth book The Silver Chair, originally entitled Night under Narnia.
              Lewis described the origin of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in an essay entitled 
              "It All Began with a Picture":
              The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood.
               This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, 
               I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it.'
              Shortly before the start of World War II, many children were evacuated to the English 
              countryside in anticipation of attacks on London and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany. 
              As a result, on 2 September 1939, three school girls, Margaret, Mary and Katherine, came to live 
              at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. 
              Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September 
              he began a children's story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:
              This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. 
              But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. 
              They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, 
              had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. 
              They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by 
              himself in the country.
              In "It All Began With a Picture" C. S. Lewis continues:
              At first I had very little idea how the story would go. 
              But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of 
              lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. 
              But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, 
              and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.
              The manuscript for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949

          <article class="publication history">
            <h3>Publication History</h3>
            <p>
              The Chronicles of Narnia's seven books have been in continuous publication since 1956, selling over 100 million copies in 47 languages and with editions in Braille.
              The first five books were originally published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles. 
              The first edition of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was released in London on 16 October 1950. 
              Although three more books, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Horse and His Boy, were already complete, 
              they were not released immediately at that time, but appeared (along with The Silver Chair) one at a time in each of the subsequent years (1951–1954). 
              The last two books (The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle) were published in the United Kingdom originally by The Bodley Head in 1955 and 1956.              
              In the United States, the publication rights were first owned by Macmillan Publishers, and later by HarperCollins. 
              The two issued both hardcover and paperback editions of the series during their tenure as publishers, 
              while at the same time Scholastic, Inc. produced paperback versions for sale primarily through direct mail order, book clubs, and book fairs. 
              Harper Collins also published several one-volume collected editions containing the full text of the series. 
              The first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books in publication sequence, 
              but when Harper Collins won the rights in 1994, at the suggestion of Lewis's stepson they used the series' internal chronological order. 
              Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994 to mirror that of Harper Collins.

          <h2>Movie History</h2>
          <article class="movies_history">
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                C. S. Lewis never sold the film rights to the Narnia series during his lifetime, as he was skeptical that any cinematic adaptation could render the more 
                fantastical elements and characters of the story realistically. Only after seeing a demo reel of CGI animals did Douglas Gresham (Lewis's stepson and literary executor, 
                and film co-producer) give approval for a film adaptation.
                Although the plan was originally to produce the films in the same order as the book series' original publication, it was reported that The Magician's Nephew, 
                which recounts the creation of Narnia, would be the fourth feature film in the series, instead of The Silver Chair. 
                It was rumoured that The Magician's Nephew was chosen as an attempt to reboot the series, after the release of 
                The Voyage of the Dawn Treader grossed less when compared to the two previous films. In March 2011, Walden Media confirmed 
                that they intended The Magician's Nephew to be next in the series, but stressed that it was not yet in development.
                In October 2011, Douglas Gresham stated that Walden Media's contract with the C. S. Lewis estate had expired, 
                hinting that Walden Media's lapse in renegotiating their contract with the C. S. Lewis estate was due to internal conflicts between both companies about the direction of future films.
                On 1 October 2013, The C. S. Lewis Company announced a partnership with The Mark Gordon Company, and that The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair was officially in pre-production.

          <h2>History of Narnia</h2>
          
          <article class="narnia_creation">
            <h3>Creation of Narnia</h3>
            <p>
              In the first year of Narnia, the Creation of Narnia was witnessed by six creatures: Jadis, Empress of Charn, Digory Kirke, Polly Plummer, Andrew Ketterley, 
              Frank the cabman, and his cab horse Strawberry. During a failed attempt by Digory to transfer Jadis from London in our world back to her own world of Charn, 
              the group arrived in the unmade darkness of Narnia just prior to Aslan calling it into being.
              Aslan began the creation soon after they arrived, and with his song called forth the stars, sun, and eventually all landforms, plants, and animals as well. 
              When he was finished, Aslan selected certain animals from these to be Talking Animals, giving to them, and all other magical creatures, Narnia as their new home, 
              to own and rule it with wisdom and caring.
              Aslan next appointed its first rulers, the cabby and his wife, as King Frank I and Queen Helen (the cabby's wife Nellie was called into Narnia by Aslan soon afterwards), 
              and commanded them to rule peacefully over the talking beasts. Aware that the evil Witch-Queen Jadis had entered his new land, Aslan sent Digory to 
              retrieve a magic apple from a garden in the Western Wild beyond Narnia. When Digory returned, the apple was planted by the river, 
              where it immediately grew into a tree which as Aslan explained would protect Narnia from Jadis for many years.
              Aslan allowed Digory to take an apple from the new tree back to our world for his ill mother. 
              After she had eaten it, Digory planted the core in his garden, where it grew into a great apple tree. 
              Many years later, the tree was blown down in a storm and Digory (who was now a professor), had its wood made into the wardrobe that 
              figures in the title of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe — for this wardrobe became the entrance through which the Pevensies would discover Narnia.

            <h3>Rule of the White Witch</h3>
            <p>
              During the Age of Conquest, Narnia remained at peace for hundreds of years after its creation until Jadis the Witch-Queen returned as the White Witch in 898. 
              She conquered Narnia and reigned as a tyrant in 900, using her wand to turn anyone who crossed her into stone. 
              With her magic she covered the land in perpetual ice and snow, making it "always winter and never Christmas"; so began Narnia's Age of Winter. 
              Though she claimed to be Queen of Narnia and Châtelaine of Cair Paravel, Jadis ruled from her own fortress in the north, 
              where her halls were lined with Narnians she had turned to stone.
              By this time, Narnia's humans have either died out or had been driven out (though humans remained in Archenland and Calormen at the time). 
              Jadis feared a prophecy that "when Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sit at Cair Paravel in throne, the evil time will be over and done." 
              Her spies were thus always watching for human intruders. 
              A hundred years into the endless winter, Lucy Pevensie entered Narnia and was befriended by Tumnus the Faun, and Lucy and her siblings managed to reach Aslan 
              before Jadis could kill them. In the Narnian year 1000, under Aslan's influence, the Witch's spells were broken and the winter came to an end. 
              Aslan restored the Narnians whom the Witch had turned into stone and killed the Witch herself at the First Battle of Beruna, and so ended the Age of Winter and 
              began the Golden Age of Narnia.

          <article class="golden_age">
            <h3>Golden Age</h3>
            <p>
              After the defeat of the Witch in 1000, 
              Aslan fulfilled the ancient Narnian prophecy and made the four Pevensie children — Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy — Kings and Queens of Narnia. 
              The ensuing prosperity inaugurated Narnia's Golden Age. In the first few years, the Pevensies vanquished the remnants of the White Witch's Army. 
              They also had to contend with other countries that had feared Jadis, but grew bolder after her death. 
              The Pevensies drove back the northern giants and in 1014 defeated an invading army from Calormen (as related in The Horse and his Boy). 
              The two Kings and two Queens were always triumphant, and during the fifteen years of their reign Narnia was a safe and happy land. 
              In 1015, the Pevensies left the Narnian world and returned to Earth, and so the Golden Age of Narnia ended. 
              Lewis tells little of the following years until the invasion of the Telmarines.

            <h3>Dark Age</h3>
            <p>
              What happened between the disappearance of the Pevensies in 1015 and the Telmarine Invasion in 1998 is unclear. 
              What is stated in the timeline is that Aravis and Cor's son, named Ram the Great, became king of Archenland in 1050, and Swanwhite II became the queen of Narnia in 1502.

            <h3>Invasion of the Telmarines</h3>
            <p>
              In the Narnian year 1998, Narnia was invaded by people from the West called the Telmarines, descendants of pirates from Earth, and so began the Telmarine Age of Narnia. 
              Led by Caspian I, they left their land in the West to escape a great famine and reached Narnia by crossing a pass in the mountains. 
              After years of Telmarine rule, the native "Old Narnians" decreased in number and went into hiding. Humans became the dominant species. 
              By the time of the birth of Caspian X (a direct descendent of Caspian I), the old days of Narnia were widely regarded as legendary and knowledge of the Old Narnians 
              was actively suppressed by the Telmarine kings. People began to fear the woods and the sea, and to forget that the old creatures had once lived there.

            <h3>The Reign of Caspian X</h3>
            <p>
                Peter Pevensie and his siblings were recalled to Narnia in the Narnian year 2303, 1288 Narnian years after their departure.
                Narnia was then ruled by the Telmarine King Miraz, who had murdered his brother Caspian IX and usurped the throne. 
                Miraz planned to murder the true heir, his nephew Prince Caspian, after the birth of his unnamed own son. 
                Caspian had learned of Old Narnia and its creatures and had become sympathetic to their plight.
                The four Pevensies helped Caspian defeat Miraz at the Second Battle of Beruna, and Caspian recovered the throne. 
                Caspian took firm control of Narnia, knighting many of his officers from the War of Deliverance and appointing a loyal council composed of both Telmarines and Narnians.
                He ensured equality and peace between the races, and renewed Narnia's alliance with Archenland. 
                He waged a successful war against the giants in the North and rebuilt the Narnian navy.
                Lucy and Edmund came to Narnia once again three years later with their cousin Eustace in the Narnian year 2306, and sailed with Caspian aboard the ship Dawn Treader. 
                Caspian undertook this journey to find the Seven Great Lords of Narnia who had been banished by Miraz to the far Eastern Seas beyond the Lone Islands.
                Caspian restored Narnian control over the Lone Islands (which had lapsed under Telmarine rule) and explored the unknown eastern islands to the very edge of the world. 
                The explorers had many adventures, including fighting a sea serpent, encountering a wizard and his invisible subjects, and Eustace being turned briefly into a dragon.
                Caspian married the daughter of a star named Ramandu. After the birth of their son Rilian, the queen was killed by a witch in the form of a serpent, and Rilian, 
                by then a young man, disappeared while searching for her.
                Eustace was drawn back to Narnia in the Narnian year 2356 along with a school friend, Jill Pole, to find that the passage of time had left Caspian an old man. 
                Caspian's son Rilian had disappeared, and as Caspian embarked on a final voyage to seek Aslan's advice about the succession, 
                the children and Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle began their own search for Rilian.
                This took them to the Wild Lands of the North, inhabited by giants, and to Underland, where they found Rilian and the Lady of the Green Kirtle, who had bewitched him. 
                They freed Rilian, who in turn killed the witch. They returned to Narnia to find Caspian dying as he returned from his voyage.

          <article class="destruction">
            <h3>Destruction</h3>
            <p>
                The world of Narnia was finally destroyed in the Narnian year 2555 at the end of the Later Ages, during the reign of King Tirian, son of King Erlian and seventh in descent from Rilian.
                A talking ape named Shift constructed an elaborate conspiracy in a selfish attempt to change Narnia to his liking. 
                By dressing a donkey named Puzzle in a lion's skin and claiming him to be Aslan, Shift began surreptitiously to gain control of the country, 
                forcing inhabitants to do his bidding in the lion's name. He then made contact with the rulers of Calormen, inviting them to conquer Narnia for their mutual advantage.
                Calormene soldiers under Captain Rishda Tarkaan soon arrived, and by the time King Tirian learned of the ape's treasonous plans, they were well on the way to completion. 
                Shift told the Calormene soldiers that Tash and Aslan were one being called "Tashlan."
                With the help of Eustace and Jill (who arrived in time to rescue the king from capture), Tirian attempted to rally Narnia and drive out the invaders, 
                but the divisive effect of the false Aslan and the capture of Cair Paravel by a Calormene fleet rendered his efforts unsuccessful. 
                Tirian and his remaining supporters came to a last stand against Rishda's army at the Battle of Stable Hill, where Tirian was defeated.
                But in the course of this final stand, the defenders were forced back into the stable and found inside to their surprise, 
                Aslan's country: all that the real Narnia ever had that was good, a Narnia-within-Narnia. Aslan was waiting for them, and told them that this final defeat signified the End.
                Opening the Stable door, the children and other survivors witnessed the end of Narnia, the dragons and salamanders uprooting the trees, 
                the in-rushing of the sea, the destruction of sun and moon, the coming home of the stars, and ultimately the end of all that existed in the world.
                Aslan called all of its inhabitants to him. Those who had been faithful were taken with him into his own land, where they met people who had died previously in Narnia. 
                Those who had been unfaithful were turned away at the entrance to the new land and faded into the shadows to an unknown fate.
                Aslan's land was bigger and better than the old Narnia, those who had died were found alive in it, because it was the "real" one, 
                whereas the old Narnia had been just a copy of Aslan's land. "That was the dream, this is reality." 
                It is also indicated that Aslan's country connected "further up and further in" to the "real" England, where Lucy Pevensie was able to see her parents, 
                who died in a train wreck that killed all the other Pevensie siblings (except Susan), as well as Digory, Polly, Eustace, and Jill.
