            <p>
                
              Although Lewis originally conceived what would become The Chronicles of Narnia 
              in 1939 (the picture of a Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating to 1914), 
              he did not finish writing the first book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe until 1949. 
              The Magician's Nephew, the penultimate book to be published, but the last to be written, 
              was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the books in the order in which they were 
              originally published, nor were they published in their current chronological order of 
              presentation. The original illustrator, 
              Pauline Baynes, created pen and ink drawings for the Narnia books that are still used in the editions 
              published today. 
              Lewis was awarded the 1956 Carnegie Medal for The Last Battle, the final book in the saga. 
              Fellow children's author Roger Lancelyn Green first referred to the series as The Chronicles of Narnia, 
              in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed fourth book The Silver Chair, originally entitled Night under Narnia.
              Lewis described the origin of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in an essay entitled 
              "It All Began with a Picture":
              The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood.
               This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, 
               I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it.'
              Shortly before the start of World War II, many children were evacuated to the English 
              countryside in anticipation of attacks on London and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany. 
              As a result, on 2 September 1939, three school girls, Margaret, Mary and Katherine, came to live 
              at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. 
              Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September 
              he began a children's story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:
              This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. 
              But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. 
              They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, 
              had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. 
              They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by 
              himself in the country.
              In "It All Began With a Picture" C. S. Lewis continues:
              At first I had very little idea how the story would go. 
              But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of 
              lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. 
              But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, 
              and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.
              The manuscript for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949

          <article class="publication history">
            <h3>Publication History</h3>
            <p>
              The Chronicles of Narnia's seven books have been in continuous publication since 1956, selling over 100 million copies in 47 languages and with editions in Braille.
              The first five books were originally published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles. 
              The first edition of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was released in London on 16 October 1950. 
              Although three more books, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Horse and His Boy, were already complete, 
              they were not released immediately at that time, but appeared (along with The Silver Chair) one at a time in each of the subsequent years (1951–1954). 
              The last two books (The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle) were published in the United Kingdom originally by The Bodley Head in 1955 and 1956.              
              In the United States, the publication rights were first owned by Macmillan Publishers, and later by HarperCollins. 
              The two issued both hardcover and paperback editions of the series during their tenure as publishers, 
              while at the same time Scholastic, Inc. produced paperback versions for sale primarily through direct mail order, book clubs, and book fairs. 
              Harper Collins also published several one-volume collected editions containing the full text of the series. 
              The first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books in publication sequence, 
              but when Harper Collins won the rights in 1994, at the suggestion of Lewis's stepson they used the series' internal chronological order. 
              Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994 to mirror that of Harper Collins.

          <h2>Movie History</h2>
          <article class="movies_history">
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                C. S. Lewis never sold the film rights to the Narnia series during his lifetime, as he was skeptical that any cinematic adaptation could render the more 
                fantastical elements and characters of the story realistically. Only after seeing a demo reel of CGI animals did Douglas Gresham (Lewis's stepson and literary executor, 
                and film co-producer) give approval for a film adaptation.
                Although the plan was originally to produce the films in the same order as the book series' original publication, it was reported that The Magician's Nephew, 
                which recounts the creation of Narnia, would be the fourth feature film in the series, instead of The Silver Chair. 
                It was rumoured that The Magician's Nephew was chosen as an attempt to reboot the series, after the release of 
                The Voyage of the Dawn Treader grossed less when compared to the two previous films. In March 2011, Walden Media confirmed 
                that they intended The Magician's Nephew to be next in the series, but stressed that it was not yet in development.
                In October 2011, Douglas Gresham stated that Walden Media's contract with the C. S. Lewis estate had expired, 
                hinting that Walden Media's lapse in renegotiating their contract with the C. S. Lewis estate was due to internal conflicts between both companies about the direction of future films.
                On 1 October 2013, The C. S. Lewis Company announced a partnership with The Mark Gordon Company, and that The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair was officially in pre-production.

          <h2>History of Narnia</h2>
          
          <article class="narnia_creation">
            <h3>Creation of Narnia</h3>
            <p>
              In the first year of Narnia, the Creation of Narnia was witnessed by six creatures: Jadis, Empress of Charn, Digory Kirke, Polly Plummer, Andrew Ketterley, 
              Frank the cabman, and his cab horse Strawberry. During a failed attempt by Digory to transfer Jadis from London in our world back to her own world of Charn, 
              the group arrived in the unmade darkness of Narnia just prior to Aslan calling it into being.
              Aslan began the creation soon after they arrived, and with his song called forth the stars, sun, and eventually all landforms, plants, and animals as well. 
              When he was finished, Aslan selected certain animals from these to be Talking Animals, giving to them, and all other magical creatures, Narnia as their new home, 
              to own and rule it with wisdom and caring.
              Aslan next appointed its first rulers, the cabby and his wife, as King Frank I and Queen Helen (the cabby's wife Nellie was called into Narnia by Aslan soon afterwards), 
              and commanded them to rule peacefully over the talking beasts. Aware that the evil Witch-Queen Jadis had entered his new land, Aslan sent Digory to 
              retrieve a magic apple from a garden in the Western Wild beyond Narnia. When Digory returned, the apple was planted by the river, 
              where it immediately grew into a tree which as Aslan explained would protect Narnia from Jadis for many years.
              Aslan allowed Digory to take an apple from the new tree back to our world for his ill mother. 
              After she had eaten it, Digory planted the core in his garden, where it grew into a great apple tree. 
              Many years later, the tree was blown down in a storm and Digory (who was now a professor), had its wood made into the wardrobe that 
              figures in the title of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe — for this wardrobe became the entrance through which the Pevensies would discover Narnia.

          <article class="white_witch">
            <h3>Rule of the White Witch</h3>
            <p>
              During the Age of Conquest, Narnia remained at peace for hundreds of years after its creation until Jadis the Witch-Queen returned as the White Witch in 898. 
              She conquered Narnia and reigned as a tyrant in 900, using her wand to turn anyone who crossed her into stone. 
              With her magic she covered the land in perpetual ice and snow, making it "always winter and never Christmas"; so began Narnia's Age of Winter. 
              Though she claimed to be Queen of Narnia and Châtelaine of Cair Paravel, Jadis ruled from her own fortress in the north, 
              where her halls were lined with Narnians she had turned to stone.
              By this time, Narnia's humans have either died out or had been driven out (though humans remained in Archenland and Calormen at the time). 
              Jadis feared a prophecy that "when Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sit at Cair Paravel in throne, the evil time will be over and done." 
              Her spies were thus always watching for human intruders. 
              A hundred years into the endless winter, Lucy Pevensie entered Narnia and was befriended by Tumnus the Faun, and Lucy and her siblings managed to reach Aslan 
              before Jadis could kill them. In the Narnian year 1000, under Aslan's influence, the Witch's spells were broken and the winter came to an end. 
              Aslan restored the Narnians whom the Witch had turned into stone and killed the Witch herself at the First Battle of Beruna, and so ended the Age of Winter and 
              began the Golden Age of Narnia.

          <article class="golden_age">
            <h3>Golden Age</h3>
            <p>
              After the defeat of the Witch in 1000, 
              Aslan fulfilled the ancient Narnian prophecy and made the four Pevensie children — Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy — Kings and Queens of Narnia. 
              The ensuing prosperity inaugurated Narnia's Golden Age. In the first few years, the Pevensies vanquished the remnants of the White Witch's Army. 
              They also had to contend with other countries that had feared Jadis, but grew bolder after her death. 
              The Pevensies drove back the northern giants and in 1014 defeated an invading army from Calormen (as related in The Horse and his Boy). 
              The two Kings and two Queens were always triumphant, and during the fifteen years of their reign Narnia was a safe and happy land. 
              In 1015, the Pevensies left the Narnian world and returned to Earth, and so the Golden Age of Narnia ended. 
              Lewis tells little of the following years until the invasion of the Telmarines.

            <p>
              What happened between the disappearance of the Pevensies in 1015 and the Telmarine Invasion in 1998 is unclear. 
              What is stated in the timeline is that Aravis and Cor's son, named Ram the Great, became king of Archenland in 1050, and Swanwhite II became the queen of Narnia in 1502.

            <h3>Invasion of the Telmarines</h3>
            <p>
              In the Narnian year 1998, Narnia was invaded by people from the West called the Telmarines, descendants of pirates from Earth, and so began the Telmarine Age of Narnia. 
              Led by Caspian I, they left their land in the West to escape a great famine and reached Narnia by crossing a pass in the mountains. 
              After years of Telmarine rule, the native "Old Narnians" decreased in number and went into hiding. Humans became the dominant species. 
              By the time of the birth of Caspian X (a direct descendent of Caspian I), the old days of Narnia were widely regarded as legendary and knowledge of the Old Narnians 
              was actively suppressed by the Telmarine kings. People began to fear the woods and the sea, and to forget that the old creatures had once lived there.

          <article class="caspian">
            <h3>The Reign of Caspian X</h3>
            <p>
                Peter Pevensie and his siblings were recalled to Narnia in the Narnian year 2303, 1288 Narnian years after their departure.
                Narnia was then ruled by the Telmarine King Miraz, who had murdered his brother Caspian IX and usurped the throne. 
                Miraz planned to murder the true heir, his nephew Prince Caspian, after the birth of his unnamed own son. 
                Caspian had learned of Old Narnia and its creatures and had become sympathetic to their plight.
                The four Pevensies helped Caspian defeat Miraz at the Second Battle of Beruna, and Caspian recovered the throne. 
                Caspian took firm control of Narnia, knighting many of his officers from the War of Deliverance and appointing a loyal council composed of both Telmarines and Narnians.
                He ensured equality and peace between the races, and renewed Narnia's alliance with Archenland. 
                He waged a successful war against the giants in the North and rebuilt the Narnian navy.
                Lucy and Edmund came to Narnia once again three years later with their cousin Eustace in the Narnian year 2306, and sailed with Caspian aboard the ship Dawn Treader. 
                Caspian undertook this journey to find the Seven Great Lords of Narnia who had been banished by Miraz to the far Eastern Seas beyond the Lone Islands.
                Caspian restored Narnian control over the Lone Islands (which had lapsed under Telmarine rule) and explored the unknown eastern islands to the very edge of the world. 
                The explorers had many adventures, including fighting a sea serpent, encountering a wizard and his invisible subjects, and Eustace being turned briefly into a dragon.
                Caspian married the daughter of a star named Ramandu. After the birth of their son Rilian, the queen was killed by a witch in the form of a serpent, and Rilian, 
                by then a young man, disappeared while searching for her.
                Eustace was drawn back to Narnia in the Narnian year 2356 along with a school friend, Jill Pole, to find that the passage of time had left Caspian an old man. 
                Caspian's son Rilian had disappeared, and as Caspian embarked on a final voyage to seek Aslan's advice about the succession, 
                the children and Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle began their own search for Rilian.
                This took them to the Wild Lands of the North, inhabited by giants, and to Underland, where they found Rilian and the Lady of the Green Kirtle, who had bewitched him. 
                They freed Rilian, who in turn killed the witch. They returned to Narnia to find Caspian dying as he returned from his voyage.

          <article class="destruction">
            <h3>Destruction</h3>
            <p>
                The world of Narnia was finally destroyed in the Narnian year 2555 at the end of the Later Ages, during the reign of King Tirian, son of King Erlian and seventh in descent from Rilian.
                A talking ape named Shift constructed an elaborate conspiracy in a selfish attempt to change Narnia to his liking. 
                By dressing a donkey named Puzzle in a lion's skin and claiming him to be Aslan, Shift began surreptitiously to gain control of the country, 
                forcing inhabitants to do his bidding in the lion's name. He then made contact with the rulers of Calormen, inviting them to conquer Narnia for their mutual advantage.
                Calormene soldiers under Captain Rishda Tarkaan soon arrived, and by the time King Tirian learned of the ape's treasonous plans, they were well on the way to completion. 
                Shift told the Calormene soldiers that Tash and Aslan were one being called "Tashlan."
                With the help of Eustace and Jill (who arrived in time to rescue the king from capture), Tirian attempted to rally Narnia and drive out the invaders, 
                but the divisive effect of the false Aslan and the capture of Cair Paravel by a Calormene fleet rendered his efforts unsuccessful. 
                Tirian and his remaining supporters came to a last stand against Rishda's army at the Battle of Stable Hill, where Tirian was defeated.
                But in the course of this final stand, the defenders were forced back into the stable and found inside to their surprise, 
                Aslan's country: all that the real Narnia ever had that was good, a Narnia-within-Narnia. Aslan was waiting for them, and told them that this final defeat signified the End.
                Opening the Stable door, the children and other survivors witnessed the end of Narnia, the dragons and salamanders uprooting the trees, 
                the in-rushing of the sea, the destruction of sun and moon, the coming home of the stars, and ultimately the end of all that existed in the world.
                Aslan called all of its inhabitants to him. Those who had been faithful were taken with him into his own land, where they met people who had died previously in Narnia. 
                Those who had been unfaithful were turned away at the entrance to the new land and faded into the shadows to an unknown fate.
                Aslan's land was bigger and better than the old Narnia, those who had died were found alive in it, because it was the "real" one, 
                whereas the old Narnia had been just a copy of Aslan's land. "That was the dream, this is reality." 
                It is also indicated that Aslan's country connected "further up and further in" to the "real" England, where Lucy Pevensie was able to see her parents, 
                who died in a train wreck that killed all the other Pevensie siblings (except Susan), as well as Digory, Polly, Eustace, and Jill.
