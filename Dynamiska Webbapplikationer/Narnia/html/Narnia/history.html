                    Although Lewis originally conceived what would become The Chronicles of Narnia 
                    in 1939 (the picture of a Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating to 1914), 
                    he did not finish writing the first book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe until 1949. 
                    The Magician's Nephew, the penultimate book to be published, but the last to be written, 
                    was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the books in the order in which they were 
                    originally published, nor were they published in their current chronological order of 
                    presentation. The original illustrator, 
                    Pauline Baynes, created pen and ink drawings for the Narnia books that are still used in the editions 
                    published today. 
                    Lewis was awarded the 1956 Carnegie Medal for The Last Battle, the final book in the saga. 
                    Fellow children's author Roger Lancelyn Green first referred to the series as The Chronicles of Narnia, 
                    in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed fourth book The Silver Chair, originally entitled Night under Narnia.
                    Lewis described the origin of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in an essay entitled 
                    "It All Began with a Picture":
                    The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood.
                     This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, 
                     I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it.'
                    Shortly before the start of World War II, many children were evacuated to the English 
                    countryside in anticipation of attacks on London and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany. 
                    As a result, on 2 September 1939, three school girls, Margaret, Mary and Katherine, came to live 
                    at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. 
                    Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September 
                    he began a children's story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:
                    This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. 
                    But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. 
                    They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, 
                    had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. 
                    They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by 
                    himself in the country.
                    In "It All Began With a Picture" C. S. Lewis continues:
                    At first I had very little idea how the story would go. 
                    But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of 
                    lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. 
                    But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, 
                    and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.
                    The manuscript for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949

                  <h3>Publication History</h3>
                  <p>
                    The Chronicles of Narnia's seven books have been in continuous publication since 1956, selling over 100 million copies in 47 languages and with editions in Braille.
                    The first five books were originally published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles. 
                    The first edition of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was released in London on 16 October 1950. 
                    Although three more books, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Horse and His Boy, were already complete, 
                    they were not released immediately at that time, but appeared (along with The Silver Chair) one at a time in each of the subsequent years (1951–1954). 
                    The last two books (The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle) were published in the United Kingdom originally by The Bodley Head in 1955 and 1956.              
                    In the United States, the publication rights were first owned by Macmillan Publishers, and later by HarperCollins. 
                    The two issued both hardcover and paperback editions of the series during their tenure as publishers, 
                    while at the same time Scholastic, Inc. produced paperback versions for sale primarily through direct mail order, book clubs, and book fairs. 
                    Harper Collins also published several one-volume collected editions containing the full text of the series. 
                    The first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books in publication sequence, 
                    but when Harper Collins won the rights in 1994, at the suggestion of Lewis's stepson they used the series' internal chronological order. 
                    Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994 to mirror that of Harper Collins.

                  <h3>Development</h3>
                  <p>
                      C. S. Lewis never sold the film rights to the Narnia series during his lifetime, as he was skeptical that any cinematic adaptation could render the more 
                      fantastical elements and characters of the story realistically. Only after seeing a demo reel of CGI animals did Douglas Gresham (Lewis's stepson and literary executor, 
                      and film co-producer) give approval for a film adaptation.
                      Although the plan was originally to produce the films in the same order as the book series' original publication, it was reported that The Magician's Nephew, 
                      which recounts the creation of Narnia, would be the fourth feature film in the series, instead of The Silver Chair. 
                      It was rumoured that The Magician's Nephew was chosen as an attempt to reboot the series, after the release of 
                      The Voyage of the Dawn Treader grossed less when compared to the two previous films. In March 2011, Walden Media confirmed 
                      that they intended The Magician's Nephew to be next in the series, but stressed that it was not yet in development.
                      In October 2011, Douglas Gresham stated that Walden Media's contract with the C. S. Lewis estate had expired, 
                      hinting that Walden Media's lapse in renegotiating their contract with the C. S. Lewis estate was due to internal conflicts between both companies about the direction of future films.
                      On 1 October 2013, The C. S. Lewis Company announced a partnership with The Mark Gordon Company, and that The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair was officially in pre-production.
