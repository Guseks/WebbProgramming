                    <h3>Aslan</h3>
                    <p>
                        Aslan, the Great Lion, is the eponymous lion of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and his role in Narnia is developed
                        throughout the remaining books. He is also the only character to appear in all seven books. Aslan
                        is a talking lion, the King of Beasts, son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea. He is a wise, compassionate,
                        magical authority (both temporal and spiritual) who serves as mysterious and benevolent guide to
                        the human children who visit, as well as being the guardian and saviour of Narnia. C. S. Lewis described
                        Aslan as an alternative version of Jesus as the form in which Christ might have appeared in an alternative
                        reality.

                <article class="character">
                    <h3>Lucy Pevensie</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all
                        the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most. In
                        The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe she initiates the story by entering Narnia through the wardrobe,
                        and (with Susan) witnesses Aslan's execution and resurrection. She is named Queen Lucy the Valiant.
                        In Prince Caspian she is the first to see Aslan when he comes to guide them. In The Voyage of the
                        Dawn Treader, it is Lucy who breaks the spell of invisibility on the Dufflepuds. As an adult in The
                        Horse and His Boy she helps fight the Calormenes at Anvard. Although a minor character in The Last
                        Battle, much of the closing chapter is seen from her point of view.

                    <h3>Edmund Pevensie</h3>
                    <p>
                        Edmund is the second child to enter Narnia in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, where he falls under the White Witch's
                        spell. Instantiating that book's Christian theme of betrayal, repentance, and subsequent redemption
                        via blood sacrifice, he betrays his siblings to her, but quickly realizes her true nature and her
                        evil intentions, and is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life. He is named King Edmund the Just.
                        In Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader he supports Lucy; in The Horse and His Boy he
                        leads the Narnian delegation to Calormen and, later, the Narnian army breaking the siege at Anvard.

                    <h3>Susan Pevensie</h3>
                    <p>
                        In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe Susan accompanies Lucy to see Aslan die and rise again. She is named Queen Susan
                        the Gentle. In Prince Caspian, however, she is the last of the four to believe and follow Lucy when
                        the latter is called by Aslan to guide them. As an adult queen in The Horse and His Boy she is courted
                        by Prince Rabadash of Calormen but refuses his marriage proposal, and his angry response leads the
                        story to its climax. In The Last Battle, we are told that she has stopped believing in Narnia and
                        remembers it only as a childhood game.

                    <h3>Peter Pevensie</h3>
                    <p>
                        Peter is the eldest of the Pevensies. In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe he kills a Talking Wolf to save Susan, and
                        leads the Narnian army against the White Witch. Aslan names him High King, and he is known as Peter
                        the Magnificent. In Prince Caspian he duels the usurper King Miraz to restore Caspian's throne. In
                        The Last Battle it is Peter whom Aslan entrusts with the duty of closing the door on Narnia for the
                        final time.

                    <h3>Eustace Scrubb</h3>
                    <p>
                        Eustace Clarence Scrubb is a cousin of the Pevensies, and a classmate of Jill Pole at their school Experiment House. He is
                        portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve his nasty behaviour when his greed
                        turns him into a dragon for a while. His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect
                        upon how horrible he has been, and he soon becomes a better person so Aslan changes him back into
                        a boy. In the later books, Eustace comes across as a much nicer person, although he is still rather
                        grumpy and argumentative. Nonetheless, he becomes a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed
                        in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in The Voyage of
                        the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.

                    <h3>Jill Pole</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jill Pole is not related to any of the other children who enter Narnia. She is a classmate and neighbour of Eustace Scrubb.
                        She appears in The Silver Chair, where she is the viewpoint character for most of the action, and
                        returns in The Last Battle. In The Silver Chair Eustace introduces her to the Narnian world, where
                        Aslan gives her the task of memorising a series of signs that will help her and Eustace on their
                        quest to find Caspian's lost son. In The Last Battle she and Eustace accompany King Tirian in his
                        ill-fated defence of Narnia against the Calormenes.

                    <h3>Digory Kirke</h3>
                    <p>
                        Digory Kirke is the character referred to in the title of The Magician's Nephew. He first appears as a minor character in
                        The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, known only as "The Professor", who hosts the Pevensie children
                        when they are evacuated from London and defends Lucy's story of having found a country in the back
                        of the wardrobe. In The Magician's Nephew the young Digory, thanks to his uncle's magical experimentation,
                        inadvertently brings Jadis from her dying homeworld of Charn to the newly-created world of Narnia;
                        to fix his mistake Aslan sends him to fetch a magical apple which will protect Narnia and heal his
                        dying mother. He returns in The Last Battle.

                    <h3>Polly Plummer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Polly Plummer appears in The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. She is the next-door neighbour of the young Digory Kirke.
                        She is tricked by a wicked magician (who is Digory's uncle) into touching a magic ring which transports
                        her to the Wood between the Worlds and leaves her there stranded. The wicked uncle persuades Digory
                        to follow her with a second magic ring that has the power to bring her back. This sets up the pair's
                        adventures into other worlds, and they witness the creation of Narnia as described in The Magician's
                        Nephew.

                    <h3>Prince Caspian / Caspian X</h3>
                    <p>
                        Prince Caspian, later to become King Caspian X of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and Emperor of The Lone Islands – also called
                        "Caspian the Seafarer" and "Caspian the Navigator" — is the title character of the second book in
                        the series, first introduced as the young nephew and heir of King Miraz of Narnia. Prince Caspian:
                        The Return to Narnia is set 1300 years after the rule of High King Peter and his siblings, when Old
                        Narnians have been driven into hiding by Caspian's ancestors the Telmarines. Caspian is also a central
                        character in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and appears briefly at the beginning and end of The
                        Silver Chair.

                    <p>
                        Jadis, commonly known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and The
                        Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. She is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting
                        in the Hundred Year Winter. The White Witch was born in the world of Charn, before the creation of
                        Narnia, and died in battle in Narnian year 1000.

                    <p>
                        Shasta, later known as Cor of Archenland, is the principal character in The Horse and His Boy. Born the eldest son and heir
                        of King Lune of Archenland, and elder twin of Prince Corin, Cor was kidnapped as an infant and raised
                        as a fisherman's son in the country of Calormen. Learning that he is about to be sold into slavery
                        at the beginning of The Horse and His Boy, Shasta escapes to freedom, saves Archenland and Narnia
                        from invasion, learns of his true identity, and is restored to his heritage. Shasta grows up to become
                        King of Archenland, marries the Calormene Tarkheena Aravis, and fathers the next (and most famous)
                        king of Archenland, Ram the Great.

                        Aravis, daughter of Kidrash Tarkaan, is a character in The Horse and His Boy. Escaping a forced betrothal to the loathsome
                        Ahoshta, she joins Shasta on his journey and inadvertently overhears a plot by Rabadash, crown prince
                        of Calormen, to invade Archenland. She later marries Shasta, now known as Prince Cor, and becomes
                        queen of Archenland at his side.

                        Bree (Breehy-hinny-brinny-hoohy-hah) is Shasta's mount and mentor in The Horse and His Boy. A Talking Horse of Narnia, he
                        wandered into Calormen as a foal and was captured. He first appears as a Calormene nobleman's war-horse;
                        when the nobleman buys Shasta as a slave, Bree organises and carries out their joint escape. Though
                        friendly, he is also vain and a braggart until his encounter with Aslan late in the story.

                    <h3>Mr Tumnus</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tumnus is a faun who is featured prominently in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and also appears in The Horse and His
                        Boy and The Last Battle. He is the first creature Lucy meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian
                        to be introduced in the series; he invites her to his home with the intention of betraying her to
                        Jadis, but quickly repents and befriends her. In The Horse and His Boy he devises the Narnian delegation's
                        plan of escape from Calormen. He returns for a brief dialogue at the end of The Last Battle. Lewis
                        said that the first Narnia story came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying
                        an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood. In that way, Tumnus was the initial inspiration for
                        the entire Narnia series.

                        Trumpkin the Dwarf is the narrator of several chapters of Prince Caspian; he is one of Caspian's rescuers and a leading figure
                        in the "Old Narnian" rebellion, and accompanies the Pevensie children from the ruins of Cair Paravel
                        to the Old Narnian camp. In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader we learn that Caspian has made him his
                        Regent in Narnia while he is away at sea, and he appears briefly in this role (now elderly and very
                        deaf) in The Silver Chair.

                    <h3>Reepicheep</h3>
                    <p>
                        Reepicheep the Mouse is the leader of the Talking Mice of Narnia in Prince Caspian. Utterly fearless, infallibly courteous,
                        obsessed with honour, he is badly wounded in the final battle but healed by Lucy and Aslan. In The
                        Voyage of the Dawn Treader his role is greatly expanded; he becomes a visionary as well as a warrior,
                        and ultimately his willing self-exile to Aslan's Country breaks the enchantment on the last three
                        of the Lost Lords, thus achieving the final goal of the quest.

                    <p>
                        Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle guides Eustace and Jill on their quest in The Silver Chair. Though always comically pessimistic,
                        he provides the voice of reason and as such intervenes critically in the climactic enchantment scene.

                    <p>
                        The last King of Narnia is the viewpoint character for much of The Last Battle. Having rashly killed a Calormene for mistreating
                        a Narnian Talking Horse, he is imprisoned by the villainous ape Shift but released by Eustace and
                        Jill. Together they fight faithfully to the last and are welcomed into Aslan's Kingdom.
