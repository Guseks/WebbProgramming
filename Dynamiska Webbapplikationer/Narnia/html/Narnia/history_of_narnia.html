                <article class="narnia_creation">
                  <h3>Creation of Narnia</h3>
                  <p>
                    In the first year of Narnia, the Creation of Narnia was witnessed by six creatures: Jadis, Empress of Charn, Digory Kirke, Polly Plummer, Andrew Ketterley, 
                    Frank the cabman, and his cab horse Strawberry. During a failed attempt by Digory to transfer Jadis from London in our world back to her own world of Charn, 
                    the group arrived in the unmade darkness of Narnia just prior to Aslan calling it into being.
                    Aslan began the creation soon after they arrived, and with his song called forth the stars, sun, and eventually all landforms, plants, and animals as well. 
                    When he was finished, Aslan selected certain animals from these to be Talking Animals, giving to them, and all other magical creatures, Narnia as their new home, 
                    to own and rule it with wisdom and caring.
                    Aslan next appointed its first rulers, the cabby and his wife, as King Frank I and Queen Helen (the cabby's wife Nellie was called into Narnia by Aslan soon afterwards), 
                    and commanded them to rule peacefully over the talking beasts. Aware that the evil Witch-Queen Jadis had entered his new land, Aslan sent Digory to 
                    retrieve a magic apple from a garden in the Western Wild beyond Narnia. When Digory returned, the apple was planted by the river, 
                    where it immediately grew into a tree which as Aslan explained would protect Narnia from Jadis for many years.
                    Aslan allowed Digory to take an apple from the new tree back to our world for his ill mother. 
                    After she had eaten it, Digory planted the core in his garden, where it grew into a great apple tree. 
                    Many years later, the tree was blown down in a storm and Digory (who was now a professor), had its wood made into the wardrobe that 
                    figures in the title of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe — for this wardrobe became the entrance through which the Pevensies would discover Narnia.

                  <h3>Rule of the White Witch</h3>
                  <p>
                    During the Age of Conquest, Narnia remained at peace for hundreds of years after its creation until Jadis the Witch-Queen returned as the White Witch in 898. 
                    She conquered Narnia and reigned as a tyrant in 900, using her wand to turn anyone who crossed her into stone. 
                    With her magic she covered the land in perpetual ice and snow, making it "always winter and never Christmas"; so began Narnia's Age of Winter. 
                    Though she claimed to be Queen of Narnia and Châtelaine of Cair Paravel, Jadis ruled from her own fortress in the north, 
                    where her halls were lined with Narnians she had turned to stone.
                    By this time, Narnia's humans have either died out or had been driven out (though humans remained in Archenland and Calormen at the time). 
                    Jadis feared a prophecy that "when Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sit at Cair Paravel in throne, the evil time will be over and done." 
                    Her spies were thus always watching for human intruders. 
                    A hundred years into the endless winter, Lucy Pevensie entered Narnia and was befriended by Tumnus the Faun, and Lucy and her siblings managed to reach Aslan 
                    before Jadis could kill them. In the Narnian year 1000, under Aslan's influence, the Witch's spells were broken and the winter came to an end. 
                    Aslan restored the Narnians whom the Witch had turned into stone and killed the Witch herself at the First Battle of Beruna, and so ended the Age of Winter and 
                    began the Golden Age of Narnia.

                  <h3>Golden Age</h3>
                  <p>
                    After the defeat of the Witch in 1000, 
                    Aslan fulfilled the ancient Narnian prophecy and made the four Pevensie children — Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy — Kings and Queens of Narnia. 
                    The ensuing prosperity inaugurated Narnia's Golden Age. In the first few years, the Pevensies vanquished the remnants of the White Witch's Army. 
                    They also had to contend with other countries that had feared Jadis, but grew bolder after her death. 
                    The Pevensies drove back the northern giants and in 1014 defeated an invading army from Calormen (as related in The Horse and his Boy). 
                    The two Kings and two Queens were always triumphant, and during the fifteen years of their reign Narnia was a safe and happy land. 
                    In 1015, the Pevensies left the Narnian world and returned to Earth, and so the Golden Age of Narnia ended. 
                    Lewis tells little of the following years until the invasion of the Telmarines.

                  <h3>Dark Age</h3>
                  <p>
                    What happened between the disappearance of the Pevensies in 1015 and the Telmarine Invasion in 1998 is unclear. 
                    What is stated in the timeline is that Aravis and Cor's son, named Ram the Great, became king of Archenland in 1050, and Swanwhite II became the queen of Narnia in 1502.

                  <h3>Invasion of the Telmarines</h3>
                  <p>
                    In the Narnian year 1998, Narnia was invaded by people from the West called the Telmarines, descendants of pirates from Earth, and so began the Telmarine Age of Narnia. 
                    Led by Caspian I, they left their land in the West to escape a great famine and reached Narnia by crossing a pass in the mountains. 
                    After years of Telmarine rule, the native "Old Narnians" decreased in number and went into hiding. Humans became the dominant species. 
                    By the time of the birth of Caspian X (a direct descendent of Caspian I), the old days of Narnia were widely regarded as legendary and knowledge of the Old Narnians 
                    was actively suppressed by the Telmarine kings. People began to fear the woods and the sea, and to forget that the old creatures had once lived there.

                  <h3>The Reign of Caspian X</h3>
                  <p>
                      Peter Pevensie and his siblings were recalled to Narnia in the Narnian year 2303, 1288 Narnian years after their departure.
                      Narnia was then ruled by the Telmarine King Miraz, who had murdered his brother Caspian IX and usurped the throne. 
                      Miraz planned to murder the true heir, his nephew Prince Caspian, after the birth of his unnamed own son. 
                      Caspian had learned of Old Narnia and its creatures and had become sympathetic to their plight.
                      The four Pevensies helped Caspian defeat Miraz at the Second Battle of Beruna, and Caspian recovered the throne. 
                      Caspian took firm control of Narnia, knighting many of his officers from the War of Deliverance and appointing a loyal council composed of both Telmarines and Narnians.
                      He ensured equality and peace between the races, and renewed Narnia's alliance with Archenland. 
                      He waged a successful war against the giants in the North and rebuilt the Narnian navy.
                      Lucy and Edmund came to Narnia once again three years later with their cousin Eustace in the Narnian year 2306, and sailed with Caspian aboard the ship Dawn Treader. 
                      Caspian undertook this journey to find the Seven Great Lords of Narnia who had been banished by Miraz to the far Eastern Seas beyond the Lone Islands.
                      Caspian restored Narnian control over the Lone Islands (which had lapsed under Telmarine rule) and explored the unknown eastern islands to the very edge of the world. 
                      The explorers had many adventures, including fighting a sea serpent, encountering a wizard and his invisible subjects, and Eustace being turned briefly into a dragon.
                      Caspian married the daughter of a star named Ramandu. After the birth of their son Rilian, the queen was killed by a witch in the form of a serpent, and Rilian, 
                      by then a young man, disappeared while searching for her.
                      Eustace was drawn back to Narnia in the Narnian year 2356 along with a school friend, Jill Pole, to find that the passage of time had left Caspian an old man. 
                      Caspian's son Rilian had disappeared, and as Caspian embarked on a final voyage to seek Aslan's advice about the succession, 
                      the children and Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle began their own search for Rilian.
                      This took them to the Wild Lands of the North, inhabited by giants, and to Underland, where they found Rilian and the Lady of the Green Kirtle, who had bewitched him. 
                      They freed Rilian, who in turn killed the witch. They returned to Narnia to find Caspian dying as he returned from his voyage.

                  <h3>Destruction</h3>
                  <p>
                      The world of Narnia was finally destroyed in the Narnian year 2555 at the end of the Later Ages, during the reign of King Tirian, son of King Erlian and seventh in descent from Rilian.
                      A talking ape named Shift constructed an elaborate conspiracy in a selfish attempt to change Narnia to his liking. 
                      By dressing a donkey named Puzzle in a lion's skin and claiming him to be Aslan, Shift began surreptitiously to gain control of the country, 
                      forcing inhabitants to do his bidding in the lion's name. He then made contact with the rulers of Calormen, inviting them to conquer Narnia for their mutual advantage.
                      Calormene soldiers under Captain Rishda Tarkaan soon arrived, and by the time King Tirian learned of the ape's treasonous plans, they were well on the way to completion. 
                      Shift told the Calormene soldiers that Tash and Aslan were one being called "Tashlan."
                      With the help of Eustace and Jill (who arrived in time to rescue the king from capture), Tirian attempted to rally Narnia and drive out the invaders, 
                      but the divisive effect of the false Aslan and the capture of Cair Paravel by a Calormene fleet rendered his efforts unsuccessful. 
                      Tirian and his remaining supporters came to a last stand against Rishda's army at the Battle of Stable Hill, where Tirian was defeated.
                      But in the course of this final stand, the defenders were forced back into the stable and found inside to their surprise, 
                      Aslan's country: all that the real Narnia ever had that was good, a Narnia-within-Narnia. Aslan was waiting for them, and told them that this final defeat signified the End.
                      Opening the Stable door, the children and other survivors witnessed the end of Narnia, the dragons and salamanders uprooting the trees, 
                      the in-rushing of the sea, the destruction of sun and moon, the coming home of the stars, and ultimately the end of all that existed in the world.
                      Aslan called all of its inhabitants to him. Those who had been faithful were taken with him into his own land, where they met people who had died previously in Narnia. 
                      Those who had been unfaithful were turned away at the entrance to the new land and faded into the shadows to an unknown fate.
                      Aslan's land was bigger and better than the old Narnia, those who had died were found alive in it, because it was the "real" one, 
                      whereas the old Narnia had been just a copy of Aslan's land. "That was the dream, this is reality." 
                      It is also indicated that Aslan's country connected "further up and further in" to the "real" England, where Lucy Pevensie was able to see her parents, 
                      who died in a train wreck that killed all the other Pevensie siblings (except Susan), as well as Digory, Polly, Eustace, and Jill.
